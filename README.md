# Text-Adventure
About 20 years ago, I got inspired to start writing a text based adventure
game similar to Advent and Dungeo that I'd played on a PDP-11 back in the
1980s.  At the time, I was using Perl quite a bit so started writing it in
Perl.  I think that I got it to the point where I could wander around the
map, pick up, and drop objects.  Instead of working on some puzzles for the
game, I decided that the most important feature to add would be Symbolic
Algebra.  Then, at some point I decided that it should be rewritten in Lisp.

So, here it is, incomplete in two languages.  But, it's ready and waiting is
I get interested in working on it some more.
