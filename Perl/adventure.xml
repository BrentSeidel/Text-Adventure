     This is the XML data file for adventure/symbolic math program.  Note that
     the XML parser used isn't completely XML compliant.  The primary deficiency
     is that comments cannot be placed within elements.

     This file contains definitions for the commands, objects, locations, and
     messages in the game.  The parser will soon be updated to allow code to
     be included in this file.

Unfortunately, I am familiar with this particular Vogon dialect and can 
translate the poetry.  It reads as follows:

        Oh feddled gruntbuggly
          thy micturations are to me
        As plurdled gabbleblotchits
          on a lurgid bee.
        Groop I implore thee,
          my foonting turlingdromes.
        And hooptiously drangle me
          with crinkly bindlewurdles,
        Or I will rend the in the gobberwarts
          with my blurglecruncheon,
        see if I don&apos;t

          - Prostenic Vogon Jeltz

Don&apos;t say that I didn&apos;t warn you.

To the north, you can see a waterfall coming from the top of the cliff.  There 
is a sizable pool of water to the base of the falls.  It looks like you could 
probably crawl behind the falls, though it is unclear what that would 
accomplish besides soaking you in cold water.  Travel to the west would be 
difficult due to a cliff.  There are some dense bushes to the south.

major events from your life.  However, on closer inspection, many of the events 
depicted seem to be of little significance or accuracy.  It does look like you
may, with some effort, be able to open the sarcophagi.

Unfortunately, the controls are not clearly labeled so that operation under 
high stress conditions would probably be difficult.  You can exit to the south.

  <msg id="start">
Sitting at your computer to try out some new software, you feel a strange 
lethargy come over you...  You awake to find yourself laying in the middle of a 
grassy field (someone seems to appreciate tired cliches).  You can see the sun 
just beginning to rise over some trees to the (presumably) east.  The early 
morning quiet begins to be shattered by the songs of birds.  As you get up to 
take stock of your situation, you notice a stream to your south and a small 
cliff to the west.  To the north as well as to the east (as you&apos;ve noticed) is 
what appears to be a forest.  You can also hear the sound of a nearby 
waterfall.
